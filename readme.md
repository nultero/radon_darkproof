# Radon Darkproof

[!Theme view](/view.png)

## A VS Code theme for insomnia, with a hint of cyberpunk.

For when all the lights are off, and the bright themes burn. Dim red and magenta are supposed to be better for your circadian than blues and greens blah blah. Medium contrast, borders are kinda muted, other elements are readable gray.

Anyone stumbling onto this probably already has a preferred syntax highlighting scheme, so I'm not even going to put any syntax color opinions into Radon. That's what the splicer is for -- Pass the **splicer.py** a theme.json from somewhere in ~/.vscode/extensions/... and it should be able to unpack it and generate a theme with its "skin" and the syntax highlighting of the theme passed in. Or don't pass it any args and it should search VS extensions and find stuff that looks like themes.
